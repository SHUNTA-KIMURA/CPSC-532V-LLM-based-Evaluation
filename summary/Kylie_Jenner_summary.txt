Kylie Kristen Jenner, born August 10, 1997, in Los Angeles, California, is an American media personality, socialite, and businesswoman. The youngest daughter of Caitlyn and Kris Jenner, she starred in the E! reality series *Keeping Up with the Kardashians* from 2007 to 2021, and later in Hulu's *The Kardashians* from 2022. At age 14 in 2012, she collaborated with her sister Kendall on the PacSun clothing line Kendall & Kylie. Time magazine listed the sisters as influential teens in 2014 and 2015 for their social media impact, and they co-authored the dystopian novel *Rebels: City of Indra: The Story of Lex and Livia*.

Jenner launched Kylie Lip Kits in 2015, which was renamed Kylie Cosmetics in 2016. In 2017, she was the youngest person on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, earning approximately $41,000,000. Forbes estimated her net worth at US$1 billion in 2019, calling her the world's youngest self-made billionaire at 21. However, Forbes later accused Jenner and her team in May 2020 of forging tax returns to create this image, though she appeared on Forbes's list of 100 Richest Self-Made Women in October 2020.

Jenner has also engaged in philanthropy, donating $500,000 from her Birthday Collection sales to Teen Cancer America in 2017 and $750,000 to the feminist organization Nest of Love in 2019. In 2017, make-up artist Vlada Haggarty claimed Jenner had stolen the creative style of her work.

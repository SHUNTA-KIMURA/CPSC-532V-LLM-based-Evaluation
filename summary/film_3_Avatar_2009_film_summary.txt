*Avatar* is set in the mid-22nd century on Pandora, a lush moon in the Alpha Centauri star system, where humans colonize to mine the valuable unobtanium mineral. The film's title refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body, operated by a remotely located human brain, used to interact with the natives. The story, described as an "emotional journey of redemption and revolution," follows a wounded former Marine who leads the indigenous race in a battle for survival against exploitation. Director James Cameron noted recurrent themes from his earlier films, including colonization, corporate greed, and a weaker group overcoming a technologically superior force, comparing the plot to a "Pocahontas" narrative.

For its production, actress Sigourney Weaver and set designers consulted a plant physiology professor to inform the depiction of Pandora's organisms and their communication. Cameron collaborated with designers, using paintings and sculptures to refine the Na'vi design when 3D renderings were insufficient. The film utilized simulcam technology, superimposing CGI images over live-action footage in real time to guide actors.

*Avatar* achieved immense box office success, breaking numerous records and becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, surpassing Cameron's *Titanic*. It earned over $77 million on its opening weekend, setting benchmarks for a non-franchise, entirely 3D, and environmentalist film. The movie was the first to gross over $2 billion worldwide and over $700 million in the United States and Canada, ultimately reaching $2.92 billion after subsequent re-releases.

"Burning" (Korean: 버닝) is a 2018 South Korean psychological thriller film co-written, produced, and directed by Lee Chang-dong, his first in eight years. Starring Yoo Ah-in, Steven Yeun, and Jeon Jong-seo, it is based on Haruki Murakami's short story "Barn Burning" and incorporates elements from William Faulkner's story of the same name. The film premiered at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival on May 16, 2018, competing for the Palme d'Or and receiving the FIPRESCI International Critics' Prize. It was released in South Korea the next day and in the United States on October 26, 2018.

The plot follows young deliveryman Jong-su, who reconnects with childhood friend Hae-mi. She asks him to feed her cat, Boil, during her trip. Upon her return, Hae-mi introduces Ben, a wealthy and enigmatic man she met abroad. Ben confesses to Jong-su his hobby of burning abandoned greenhouses. Hae-mi subsequently disappears, prompting Jong-su to investigate. He finds her apartment unnaturally clean and the cat gone. Growing suspicious of Ben, Jong-su discovers a pink watch similar to Hae-mi's and other women's jewelry in Ben's apartment, and that Ben's new cat responds to "Boil." Convinced of Ben's involvement, Jong-su lures him to the countryside, stabs him, and sets his body and car ablaze.

"Burning" received widespread critical acclaim for its sense of unease, ambiguous narrative, and performances. It was South Korea's entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 91st Academy Awards, becoming the first Korean film to make the nine-film shortlist. The film garnered numerous accolades, appeared on several "top ten" lists for 2018, and was voted the best Korean film of all time in a poll of over 150 critics, displacing films like *Parasite* and *Oldboy*.

The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf, selectively bred by hunter-gatherers during the Late Pleistocene. Genetic studies indicate dogs diverged from wolves 27,000 to 40,000 years ago, with domestication occurring at least 14,000 years ago, or potentially 23,000 years ago in Siberia. Dogs share physical traits with wolves, including powerful jaws with around 42 teeth and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. They possess superior smell and hearing compared to humans but inferior visual acuity, struggling with red and green differentiation. Selective breeding has led to extreme size variability, from Great Danes to Chihuahuas, and their skeleton is well-adapted for running.

The global dog population is estimated between 700 million and 1 billion, with approximately 75% residing in developing countries as feral or street dogs. Their median longevity is about 12.7 years. Dogs perform numerous roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, and assisting police, military, and disabled individuals. Over millennia, dogs have uniquely adapted to human behavior, enabling understanding and communication. This sophisticated social cognition contributes to their trainability and integration into human households. The human–canine bond is frequently studied, and dogs' influence on human society has earned them the sobriquet "man's best friend," with an increased role in emotional support.

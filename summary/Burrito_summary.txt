Historically, a burrito or burro was a regional name for what was known as a taco in other parts of Mexico, particularly in states like Guanajuato, Guerrero, and Sonora. In Mexico City, it was a taco, and in Yucatán, a codzito. Mexico City's cultural influence led to "taco" becoming the default, causing "burrito" to acquire new meanings. Today, in Central and Southern Mexico, burritos are still known as "tacos de harina" (wheat flour tacos).

In modern times, many consider the burrito a distinct dish in Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine, originating in Ciudad Juárez. It features a flour tortilla wrapped into a sealed cylindrical shape around various savory ingredients, such as meat (beef, chicken, pork), rice, cooked beans, vegetables, cheese, and condiments. Burritos are contrasted with tacos, which use a smaller, folded tortilla, and enchiladas, which are corn masa tortillas covered in sauce. The Maya civilization used corn tortillas to wrap foods as early as 1500 BC. While the precise origin of the modern burrito is unknown, historical dictionaries from 1895 onwards identified "burrito" as a regional name for a rolled tortilla or taco. Frances Erskine Inglis documented eating "burros" (tortillas with cheese) in Michoacán in 1843, and a folk history attributes its modern form to Juan Méndez in Ciudad Juárez during the Mexican Revolution.

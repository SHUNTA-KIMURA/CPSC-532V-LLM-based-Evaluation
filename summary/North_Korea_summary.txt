North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), is an East Asian country constituting the northern half of the Korean Peninsula, bordering China, Russia, and South Korea. It is a totalitarian dictatorship with a comprehensive cult of personality around the Kim family, with all three supreme leaders from this lineage. The Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) is the sole ruling party, its leadership enshrined in the constitution, and Kim Jong Un is the current supreme leader. Its state philosophy, Juche, was described as "the only scientific thought."

After Japan's 1945 surrender, Korea was divided, leading to the 1948 formation of the socialist DPRK in the north and the capitalist Republic of Korea in the south. The Korean War devastated North Korea, resulting in an estimated 12–15% population loss. A CIA study acknowledged post-war achievements including improved women's status, free housing, and healthcare. However, the economy stagnated by the 1980s and collapsed after Soviet aid ceased in 1991. Mid-1990s flooding exacerbated this, causing widespread famine and 240,000 to 420,000 deaths.

North Korea possesses nuclear weapons and maintains one of the world's largest militaries, the Korean People's Army (KPA), with 1.28 million active troops. A 2014 UN inquiry found "systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations," describing it as having "no parallel in the contemporary world."

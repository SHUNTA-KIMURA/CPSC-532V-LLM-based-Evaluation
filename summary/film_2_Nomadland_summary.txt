"Nomadland," a 2020 film written, produced, edited, and directed by Chloé Zhao, is based on Jessica Bruder's 2017 nonfiction book. It stars Frances McDormand as Fern, a widow who, after losing her job in Empire, Nevada, sells her belongings to live and travel in a van, seeking work. Real-life nomads, including Linda May, Swankie, and Bob Wells, appear as fictionalized versions of themselves. McDormand initiated the project, approaching Zhao to direct. Fern's journey involves connecting with a nomadic community, learning of Swankie's cancer diagnosis and desire to make memories, and ultimately maintaining her independent lifestyle after a return to Empire.

The film premiered on September 11, 2020, at the Venice Film Festival, winning the Golden Lion, and also received the People's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival. It achieved critical acclaim and box office success, grossing $39 million worldwide against its $5 million budget. "Nomadland" won Best Picture, Best Director for Zhao, and Best Actress for McDormand at the 93rd Academy Awards. Zhao became the second woman and first non-white woman to win Best Director, and McDormand the first woman to win Academy Awards for both acting and producing for the same film. It also secured Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Director at the 78th Golden Globe Awards, and multiple awards at the British Academy Film Awards and Independent Spirit Awards. Its planned release in China was canceled due to censorship related to Zhao's past remarks.

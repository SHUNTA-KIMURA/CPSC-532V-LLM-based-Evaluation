Pizza is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat, leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, traditionally baked at high temperatures, often in a wood-fired oven. The term "pizza" was first recorded in 997 AD in a Latin manuscript from Gaeta, Italy, appearing in a notarial document demanding payment in pizzas. While ancient flatbreads with toppings existed, modern pizza evolved from similar dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century.

A popular legend attributes the 1889 creation of pizza Margherita for Queen Margherita, featuring red, white, and green toppings, but later research casts doubt on this story, suggesting it was promoted in the 1930s–1940s. Neapolitan pizza gained significant recognition: it was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish in 2009, and the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage in 2017.

Pizza is among the world's most popular foods, ranking after rice and before pasta. In 2017, the global pizza market was US$128 billion, with the US market alone accounting for $44 billion across 76,000 pizzerias. Crust styles vary widely, from thin Neapolitan to thick deep-dish. Regional varieties include authentic Neapolitan pizza, Sicilian pizza (a thick-crust focaccia variant), and Argentine pizza, a cultural icon in Buenos Aires. Argentine pizza is characterized by a thick, spongy base and elevated bready crust, and Argentina has the most pizzerias per inhabitant globally.

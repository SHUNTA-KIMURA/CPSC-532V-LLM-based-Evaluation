Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae, part of the order Lagomorpha, which also includes hares and pikas. They are a paraphyletic grouping, as hares (genus Lepus) are nested within Leporidae but are not described as rabbits. The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is the ancestor of hundreds of domestic breeds and has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica. Rabbits are altricial, born hairless and blind in burrows, unlike precocial hares.

Rabbits reproduce quickly, having short pregnancies and large litters of four to twelve kits, with no particular mating season. However, they experience high embryo mortality and are susceptible to widespread diseases like rabbit hemorrhagic disease and myxomatosis. Their ears are essential for thermoregulation and predator detection, containing a high density of blood vessels and ossicles in the middle ear that decrease sound. Rabbits typically graze on grass and a variety of plants.

Humans have utilized rabbits as livestock since at least the first century BC in ancient Rome, raising them for meat, fur, and wool; this practice is known as cuniculture. Wild rabbits and hares are also hunted for game. Rabbits hold global cultural significance, appearing as symbols of fertility, cunning, innocence, and vulnerability in religions, art, and folklore. They are also prominent as trickster figures in American popular culture. Taxonomically, rabbits and rodents are grouped in the clade Glires, a relationship solidified by fossil, DNA, and retrotransposon studies.

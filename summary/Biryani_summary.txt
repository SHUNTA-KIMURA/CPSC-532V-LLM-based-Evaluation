Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating in South Asia, traditionally made with rice, meat or seafood, vegetables, and spices. Its name derives from the Persian "biryan" or "beriyan," meaning "to fry" or "to roast." Highly popular in South Asia and among the diaspora, it is often associated with the region's Muslim population, being the most-ordered dish on Indian online food services and widely used in celebrations.

The dish's precise origin is debated, though it was present in Mughal-era India. It is thought to derive from a Persian rice dish like pilau. Food historian Lizzie Collingham suggests it developed in Mughal court kitchens, combining Persian slow-cooking and yoghurt-marinated meat with a spicy Indian style. Other theories propose it arrived in South India before the Mughal era, possibly from Persia. Historical texts mention both pilau and biryani, with Sebastien Manrique distinguishing them in 1641.

Biryani can be prepared using pakki ("cooked") or kacchi ("raw") techniques, the latter involving layered ingredients sealed and slow-cooked. It differs from pilau by having a stronger curried taste, more spices and gravy, and often includes additional dressings or scorched rice. Pratibha Karan notes biryani has two layers of rice with a meat/vegetable layer in the middle, unlike pilau. Varieties have spread globally, often by South Asian diaspora.

The domestic cat (Felis catus), a small carnivorous mammal, is the only domesticated species of the Felidae family. Its domestication began in the Near East around 7500 BCE, a process that significantly altered the ancestral wildcat genome. Cats possess a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and well-developed night vision and an acute sense of smell. They are social but solitary, crepuscular hunters, though their color vision is poor, optimized for blue and yellowish green.

Cats lap water rapidly, retracting their tongue like a corkscrew. While excelling in observational learning, they struggle with human-like cause-and-effect understanding. Globally, domestic cats are valued for companionship and vermin control, being the second most popular pet in the U.S. as of 2024. Pet humanization, treating cats like family, is a growing trend. Proper care includes providing a safe space, multiple resources, play, positive social interaction, and annual veterinary check-ups.

Pet abandonment contributes to a large global feral cat population, estimated at 25-60 million in the U.S. These feral cats are significant predators, killing billions of birds and mammals annually, and have driven the decline and extinction of numerous species, such as the Lyall's wren. Accidental poisoning is also common in cats from various sources like toxic plants, unsuitable foods, and household substances.

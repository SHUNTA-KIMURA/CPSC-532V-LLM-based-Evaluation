Si Ronda was a 1930 silent film from the Dutch East Indies, directed by Lie Tek Swie and starring Bachtiar Effendi in his on-screen debut. Based on contemporary Betawi oral tradition, the film followed the exploits of the bandit Si Ronda, who was skilled in silat (traditional Malay martial arts). In the lenong stories from which the film was derived, Ronda was often depicted as a Robin Hood-type figure, reputed to take from the rich to give to the poor. The Indonesian film scholar Misbach Yusa Biran suggests Ronda was selected for adaptation due to its potential for action sequences, which were well-received by audiences and often inspired by American works.

Produced by Tan Khoen Yauw of Tan's Film, with cinematography by A. Loepias, the black-and-white film also featured actor Momo. Si Ronda was part of a popular genre of bandit films in domestic cinema, which emerged after the 1929 release of Si Tjonat. This genre, which included adaptations of stories like Si Jampang and Si Pitung, constituted a quarter of all domestic releases between 1929 and 1931, though not all maintained the central character's heroic qualities.

Released in 1930, Si Ronda received little media coverage and is now thought lost, though some pre-1950 Indonesian films are recorded as having survived. The Ronda stories were adapted again in 1978 as Si Ronda Macan Betawi, directed by Fritz G. Schadt. This later adaptation depicted Ronda using his silat skills to fight corrupt landowners and colonial government workers.

Canada, a North American country, is the world's second-largest by total area, extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific and Arctic Oceans with the longest coastline. It shares the longest international land border with the United States. With over 41 million people, the majority reside in urban areas, while large regions remain sparsely populated. Ottawa is the capital, and Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver are its largest metropolitan areas. Formed in 1867 as a federal dominion, Canada's sovereignty evolved through the Statute of Westminster, 1931, and culminated in the Canada Act 1982, which severed legal dependence on the UK Parliament, patriated the constitution, and established the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The prime minister serves as head of government, appointed by the governor general representing the monarch, the ceremonial head of state. Canada consistently ranks highly in government transparency, quality of life, economic competitiveness, innovation, education, and human rights.

As a developed country, Canada boasts a highly developed, mixed-market economy, ranking as the world's ninth-largest by nominal GDP, relying on abundant natural resources and international trade. It is recognized as one of the most educated countries globally, with over 56 percent of adults holding tertiary education. Canada is a middle power, known for its foreign policies of multilateralism, internationalism, peacekeeping, and aid for developing countries. Post-war economic growth fostered a distinct Canadian identity, marked by the adoption of the maple leaf flag, official bilingualism, and multiculturalism.

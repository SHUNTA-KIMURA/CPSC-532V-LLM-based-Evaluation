Madagascar, the world's fourth-largest island off Africa's southeastern coast, is a biodiversity hotspot with over 90% endemic wildlife due to its isolation. This unique fauna is vulnerable; the 2014 discovery of the Asian common toad raised concerns, and human settlement led to numerous lemur extinctions.

In the early 19th century, Merina nobles united much of Madagascar as a kingdom. Radama expanded it and abolished the slave trade in 1817, gaining British recognition as "King of Madagascar." A Queen later used forced labor and a large Merina army to consolidate control, with Antananarivo becoming the administrative center. Malagasy and French are official languages. The Malagasy people's genetic makeup blends Southeast Asian and East African genes, with Merina showing predominant Southeast Asian features; ancestor veneration is a key practice.

Economically, the country faced bankruptcy by 1979 after the 1973 oil crisis. Though still very poor in 2018, the economy has grown since 2011, with GDP growth exceeding 4% annually and unemployment cut to 2.1% in 2016. Challenges like corruption and legal uncertainty remain. The UN and World Food Programme began a country program in 2015 for development and to address food insecurity.

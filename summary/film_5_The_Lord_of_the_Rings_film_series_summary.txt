The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy adventure film trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, based on the novel by J. R. R. Tolkien. The films, titled *The Fellowship of the Ring* (2001), *The Two Towers* (2002), and *The Return of the King* (2003), are set in the fictional world of Middle-earth. The plot follows the hobbit Frodo Baggins on a quest to destroy the One Ring to defeat its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron. Meanwhile, Aragorn, heir to Gondor, unites with other companions to save the Free Peoples of Middle-earth from Sauron's forces and rally them in the War of the Ring to aid Frodo.

The trilogy was shot simultaneously in Jackson's native New Zealand from 1999 to 2000, with pick-up shots continuing until 2003. Jackson initially proposed a single *Hobbit* film followed by two *Lord of the Rings* films, and secured an increased budget after a preview of *The Fellowship of the Ring*. The series is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential film series ever made, receiving numerous accolades, including 17 Academy Awards out of 30 nominations. *The Return of the King* notably won 11 Oscars, including Best Picture, setting a record for the highest clean sweep and tying *Ben-Hur* and *Titanic*. Technical awards were also granted for skin textures and the MASSIVE animation system.

Opinions vary on the films' faithfulness to the novel, with some critics noting a weakening of characters and story due to an emphasis on action and violence, a loss of psychological depth, and a shift from Tolkien's themes of free will. Nevertheless, the trilogy's success led to a surge of interest in Tolkien's works, vastly increasing his impact on popular culture. Peter Jackson became a major figure in the film industry, and the series brought about a resurgence of epic fantasy in mainstream media, also leading to *The Hobbit* film trilogy (2012-2014).

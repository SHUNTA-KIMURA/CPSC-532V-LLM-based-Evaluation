Vatican City is an enclave within Rome, Italy, serving as the administrative center of the Catholic Church. It is the world's smallest sovereign state by both area, at 48.99 hectares (121 acres), and population, with about 882 residents in 2024. Governed by the Holy See, it functions as an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state, ruled by the pope, who is the head of state, bishop of Rome, and head of the Catholic Church. The independent state of Vatican City was established in 1929 via the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy, recognized as a new creation rather than a remnant of the former Papal States.

The Holy See, a sovereign entity under international law, is distinct from Vatican City State and serves as the central governing body of the Catholic Church and Vatican City, comprising the pope and the Roman Curia. It maintains temporal power, governance, diplomacy, and spiritual independence, with its origins dating back to early Christianity. As the principal episcopal see of the Catholic Church, which had approximately 1.329 billion baptized Catholics globally in 2018, the Holy See holds permanent observer status at the UN General Assembly.

Vatican City's economy is financially supported by donations from Catholic believers, the sale of postage stamps, coins, medals, and souvenirs, fees for museum admission, and sales of publications. The state contains significant religious and cultural sites such as St Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, the Vatican Apostolic Library, and the Vatican Museums. Citizenship is granted based on appointment to work for the Holy See (*jus officii*), and while Vatican City has no armed forces of its own, the Swiss Guard is responsible for the personal security of the pope.

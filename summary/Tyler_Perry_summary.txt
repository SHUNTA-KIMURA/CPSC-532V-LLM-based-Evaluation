Tyler Perry is the creator and performer of Mabel "Madea" Simmons, a tough elderly woman, also portraying her brother Joe and nephew Brian. His breakthrough came in 2005 with the film *Diary of a Mad Black Woman*, which he wrote and produced as an adaptation of his stage play. He developed numerous successful television series, including *Tyler Perry's House of Payne* and *The Haves and the Have Nots*, with the latter achieving record-high ratings. Perry established Tyler Perry Studios, one of the largest film studios in the U.S., becoming the second African American to own a major film studio outright. His films and shows have cumulatively grossed over $660 million, and his net worth is an estimated $1 billion, making him one of the richest in entertainment.

Despite commercial success, Perry's productions have faced criticism from critics and scholars for perpetuating negative portrayals of African Americans, with critical reception often being largely negative; *Diary of a Mad Black Woman* scored 16% on Rotten Tomatoes. Conversely, Perry has garnered multiple significant accolades, including being named one of Time's 100 most influential people in 2020, receiving the Governor's Award, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, and induction into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame.

Perry's work often reflects themes of predominantly black church culture. He notably provided initial security and housing for Prince Harry and Meghan in 2020. Perry has also faced legal challenges, including unfair labor practice charges from the Writers Guild of America West and sexual assault lawsuits, though some claims were later discredited.

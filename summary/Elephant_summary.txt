Elephants are the largest living land animals and the sole surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea, with extinct relatives including mammoths and mastodons. Three living species are recognized: the African bush elephant, African forest elephant, and Asian elephant. Distinctive features include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. Elephants are found across sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, inhabiting diverse environments such as savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are considered keystone species due to their significant impact on their environments and live in fission-fusion societies where calves are central and rely on their mothers for up to three years.

The earliest proboscideans, like Eritherium from 60 million years ago, were much smaller than living elephants. Proboscideans underwent a dramatic decline during the Late Pleistocene extinctions, with mammoths surviving on Wrangel Island until approximately 4,000 years ago. African bush elephants, which live in the hottest climates, possess the largest ear flaps. While African elephants have tusks in both sexes, Asian males can have long but typically slimmer tusks.

Conservation status is critical: African bush elephants are listed as Endangered, African forest elephants as Critically Endangered, and Asian elephants as Endangered by the IUCN. A major threat is poaching for ivory, meat, and hides, though China and the United States enacted bans on ivory import/export in 2015. Asian elephants also face human-wildlife conflict due to crop trampling. Elephants are used as working animals in Asia and were historically employed in war. Today, their display in zoos and use in circuses are controversial, with some studies suggesting wild elephants in protected areas live more than twice as long as those in European zoos.

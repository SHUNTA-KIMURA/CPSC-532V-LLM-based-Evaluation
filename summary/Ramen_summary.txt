Ramen is a Japanese Chinese cuisine dish featuring Chinese-style alkaline wheat noodles (chūkamen) served in various flavors of hot broth. Its origins trace back to Yokohama Chinatown in the late 19th century, evolving from southern Chinese noodle dishes, reflecting the demographics of Chinese immigrants in the area. Chūkamen are typically made from wheat flour, salt, water, and kansui.

The word "ramen" is a Japanese borrowing of the Chinese *lāmiàn* ("pulled noodles"). However, ramen does not derive from *lamian* dishes, which are part of northern Chinese cuisine. This is a common misconception, and how ramen adopted its name from *lamian* remains unclear, though it may be linked to Japanese repatriates from China after World War II who encountered *lamian* in northern China.

Initially confined to Japan's Chinese community, ramen gained nationwide popularity after World War II, following increased wheat consumption due to rice shortages and the return of Japanese colonial settlers. The release of Nissin Chikin Ramen in 1958 further spread its name. Today, ramen is considered a national dish of Japan, with over 24,000 shops nationwide. Nearly every region has its own variation, such as Kyushu's tonkotsu ramen or Hokkaido's miso ramen, with specialist *rāmen'ya* shops typically offering the best quality.

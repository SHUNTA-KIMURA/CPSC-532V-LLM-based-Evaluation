Parrots (Psittaciformes), or psittacines, are birds characterized by a strong curved beak, upright stance, and clawed feet. Classified into four families with roughly 410 species in 101 genera, they are found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions globally, with the greatest diversity in South America and Australasia. Their distribution spans all tropical and subtropical continents, including Australia, Oceania, Asia, Central and South America, and Africa.

Among the most intelligent birds, parrots are known for their ability to imitate human speech, which boosts their popularity as pets. They exhibit high dexterity, using their feet to manipulate objects like human hands, and uniquely display true tripedalism, using their necks and beaks as propulsive limbs for climbing. However, a fossil once considered a parrot might be from a non-avian dinosaur.

Despite their unique traits, one-third of all parrot species are threatened with extinction, facing a higher aggregate risk than any other comparable bird group. Principal threats include habitat loss, hunting, and the wild-bird trade, which has led to significant exploitation and diminished wild populations. The popularity of parrots as pets fuels a thriving, often illegal, trade, regulated by CITES since 1975. Culturally, parrots have featured in human writings, art, and religion for millennia, from ancient Chinese ritual sacrifices to Polynesian legends.
